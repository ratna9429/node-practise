// Compare Adjacent Elements: Start from the first element and compare it with the next element.
// Swap if Needed: If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
// Pass Through the Array: Continue comparing and swapping for every adjacent pair in the array.
// Largest Element Bubbles Up: After the first pass, the largest element will have moved to its correct position (end of the array).
// Repeat for Remaining Elements: Continue the passes for the remaining unsorted part of the array.
// Stop When Sorted: If a pass results in no swaps, the array is fully sorted, and the algorithm stops.
